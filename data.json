stay is the cost of admission to what is probably one of the most spectacular vistas in the Mediterranean).", "And they probably want to avoid the afternoon tea phenomenon \u9225?", "not that I blame

the bathroom at the Hotel de Russie in Rome.", "I think the bathroom is the most important part of a hotel room and would gladly give up extra room real estate if it would buy me a larger bathroom.",

ways as well.", "The 1898 may be a better value because it is much, much more affordably priced while offering many similar amenities and services.", "But there really is no comparison.", "These hotels have a different vibe \u9225?", "that of the CF is decidedly more up-market.", "Of course most of the tourists in both hotels were Americans and the dollar is just not what it used to be.", "I

day and felt like I was in Battery Park City, NYC \u9225?", "totally cut off from the rest of the city.", "And what\u9225\u6a9a up with the lack of a restaurant on a high floor?", "How could they forget to utilize the best amenity they have, and charge dearly for: the stellar views!", "It must be reserved for hotel guests (no less than one nights stay is the cost of admission to what is probably one of the most spectacular vistas in the Mediterranean).", "And they probably want to avoid the afternoon tea phenomenon \u9225?", "not that I blame them.", "In the meantime, the Casa Fuster
